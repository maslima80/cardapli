## 📋 Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migrations (CRITICAL - Run in order)

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor:

#### A. Onboarding Updates
```sql
-- File: UPDATE_ONBOARDING_TO_4_STEPS.sql
-- Purpose: Remove theme step, update to 4 steps
-- Impact: All users
```

#### B. Clean Old Hints
```sql
-- File: CLEAN_OLD_HINTS.sql
-- Purpose: Remove theme_done and old profile_done hints
-- Impact: Hint system
```

#### C. Price Optional
```sql
-- File: FIX_PRICE_OPTIONAL.sql
-- Purpose: Make price nullable when price_on_request = true
-- Impact: Product creation
```

#### D. Product Slug Trigger
```sql
-- File: ADD_PRODUCT_SLUG_TRIGGER.sql
-- Purpose: Auto-generate slugs for products
-- Impact: Product creation
```

### 2. Verify Migrations

After running migrations, verify:

```sql
-- Check onboarding steps count
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT step) FROM user_progress;
-- Should return: 4

-- Check price column is nullable
SELECT is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'products' AND column_name = 'price';
-- Should return: YES

-- Check slug trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'products_slug_trigger';
-- Should return: products_slug_trigger
```
