# ðŸ§ª Test Navigation to Profile Section

## What Should Happen

When you click "1. Complete seu Perfil" in the onboarding:
1. âœ… Navigate to `/perfil?section=profile`
2. âœ… Show the "Perfil e NegÃ³cio" form (Image 2)
3. âœ… Scroll to top smoothly
4. âœ… Console shows: `[PerfilV2] Section param from URL: profile`

---

## How to Test

1. **Refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go to dashboard** (`/inicio`)
3. **Click on "1. Complete seu Perfil"** in the onboarding progress card
4. **Check:**
   - URL should be `/perfil?section=profile`
   - Should see the form with Logo, Nome do negÃ³cio, Slogan, etc.
   - Should NOT see the main cards view

---

## If It's Not Working

### Check Console
Look for:
```
[PerfilV2] Section param from URL: profile
```

If you see this but still see the cards view, there might be a rendering issue.

### Manually Test URL
Type in browser: `http://localhost:5173/perfil?section=profile`

Should show the form directly.

---

## Code Changes Made

1. âœ… Added logging to see when section param changes
2. âœ… Added smooth scroll to top when section opens
3. âœ… Ensured activeSection resets to null when no param

---

## Expected Flow

```
Dashboard â†’ Click "Complete seu Perfil" 
  â†“
Navigate to /perfil?section=profile
  â†“
PerfilV2 reads ?section=profile
  â†“
Sets activeSection = 'profile'
  â†“
Shows ProfileSection form (Image 2)
```

---

## Debug Steps

If still showing cards instead of form:

1. Check browser console for `[PerfilV2] Section param from URL:`
2. Check if URL has `?section=profile`
3. Try clicking the "Perfil" card directly (should also work)
4. Check if there are any React errors in console
