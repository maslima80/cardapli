# Premium Catalog - Final Touches ✨

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Removed Automatic Section Dividers 🎯

**Problem:**
- Automatic dividers like "LOCALIZAÇÃO E CONTATO" appeared when blocks were grouped
- Users had no control over them
- Caused confusion when drag-and-dropping blocks
- Felt rigid and imposed

**Solution:**
- Removed all automatic section dividers
- Users now have full control over their catalog structure
- Drag & drop works seamlessly
- Cleaner, more flexible layouts

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/catalog/CatalogBlocksLayout.tsx`

**Result:**
✅ No more imposed structure
✅ Perfect drag & drop experience
✅ User-controlled layout
✅ Still maintains premium spacing

### 2. Social Media Icons - Brand Color Default 🎨

**Problem:**
- Social media icons used hardcoded brand colors (Instagram pink, YouTube red, etc.)
- Didn't blend with the rest of the catalog
- Felt disconnected from the brand identity

**Solution:**
- **Default changed:** `use_accent_color` now defaults to `true`
- Icons now use the **profile's accent color** by default
- Creates cohesive, premium look across the entire catalog
- Users can still toggle back to brand colors if they want

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/catalog/blocks/SocialsBlockPremium.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const useAccentColor = data.use_accent_color || false;

// After
const useAccentColor = data.use_accent_color !== false; // Default to true
const accentColor = profile?.accent_color || '#8B5CF6';
```

**Result:**
✅ Cohesive brand experience
✅ Icons match catalog theme
✅ Professional, unified look
✅ Still customizable via toggle
