# Cover Block Full-Bleed Implementation ‚úÖ

## Summary
Successfully implemented true full-bleed (edge-to-edge) images for 3 of 4 cover layout options in the Cardapli catalog builder.

## What Was Fixed
The previous implementation used negative margins (`mx-[-1.5rem]`) which broke the layout. The new implementation properly integrates with the `BlockWrapper` component to achieve true full-bleed rendering.

## Cover Layout Options

### 1. üèÜ Logo + T√≠tulo + Foto (logo-title-image)
- **Full-bleed**: ‚úÖ YES
- Logo and title at top with padding
- Square image below that extends edge-to-edge
- No borders or rounded corners on image

### 2. üì∏ Imagem no Topo (image-top)
- **Full-bleed**: ‚úÖ YES
- Square image at top extends edge-to-edge
- Logo and title below with padding
- No borders or rounded corners on image

### 3. üé† Galeria de Fotos (carousel-top)
- **Full-bleed**: ‚ùå NO
- **Center-focused carousel** with side previews
- Center image (70% width on mobile, 60% on desktop) fully visible
- Left and right images partially visible to indicate scrollability
- Logo at top (if enabled), images in center, title/subtitle below
- Swipeable with snap-to-center behavior
- Rounded corners (rounded-2xl) with shadow
- Aspect ratio: 4:5 (portrait orientation like product catalog)

### 4. üñºÔ∏è Imagem de Fundo (full-background)
- **Full-bleed**: ‚úÖ YES
- Background image extends edge-to-edge
- Text overlaid on image with gradient
- Fills entire viewport width

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/catalog/BlockRenderer.tsx`
- Updated `isFullBleed` logic to include new cover layouts
- Added comments explaining which layouts are full-bleed

### 2. `src/components/catalog/BlockRendererPremium.tsx`
- Updated `isFullBleed` logic to match BlockRenderer
- Ensures premium catalogs also render correctly

### 3. `src/components/catalog/blocks/CoverBlock.tsx`
- Removed negative margin hacks (`mx-[-1.5rem] w-[calc(100%+3rem)]`)
- Let BlockWrapper handle full-bleed behavior
- Updated image optimization to use `isFullBleed: true` parameter
- Added spacing adjustments for better text layout
- Added clear comments for each layout type

## Technical Details

### How Full-Bleed Works
1. **BlockRenderer** marks certain blocks as `fullBleed={true}`
2. **BlockWrapper** removes padding and container when `fullBleed` is true
3. **CoverBlock** renders at full width without negative margins
4. Images extend truly edge-to-edge across the viewport

### Image Optimization
- Full-bleed images use `w-1600` ImageKit transformation
- Non-full-bleed images use `w-1200` transformation
- All images use `q-80,dpr-auto,c-maintain_ratio` for optimal quality

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test logo-title-image layout on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Test image-top layout on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Test carousel-top layout (should have padding)
- [ ] Test full-background layout on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Verify images load edge-to-edge without gaps
- [ ] Check dark mode rendering
- [ ] Test with and without logo enabled
- [ ] Verify layout switcher in settings drawer

## Carousel Layout Design Update

The carousel layout was redesigned to match modern product catalog aesthetics:

### Before
- 3 images side-by-side with equal visibility
- 80% width each with infinite scroll
- Square aspect ratio

### After
- **Center-focused design** inspired by product catalogs
- Center image prominently displayed (70% mobile / 60% desktop)
- Side images partially visible (15-20% padding on each side)
- Portrait aspect ratio (4:5) for better product showcase
- Logo moved to top for cleaner hierarchy
- Swipeable with snap-to-center for smooth UX

This creates a more dynamic, engaging cover that hints at interactivity while maintaining professional aesthetics.

## Result
‚úÖ 3 of 4 cover layouts now display images in true full-bleed (edge-to-edge)
‚úÖ Carousel layout redesigned with center-focused, swipeable design
‚úÖ No layout breaking or overflow issues
‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code without negative margin hacks
‚úÖ Professional product catalog aesthetic
