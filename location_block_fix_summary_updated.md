# Location Block Fix Summary - Updated

## Issues Fixed

1. **React Key Warning**: Fixed the `loc-undefined` key issue by properly handling undefined location IDs.
2. **Location Selection Bug**: Fixed the issue where selecting/deselecting one location affected all locations.
3. **Data Persistence Issue**: Fixed the persistence of title, description, and selected locations.
4. **Empty State After Refresh**: Fixed the issue where the location card disappeared after refreshing.

## Key Changes Made

### LocationBlockSettings.tsx

1. **Fixed Undefined ID Handling**:
   - Added validation to filter out locations with undefined or empty IDs
   - Changed key generation to use fallback to index when ID is undefined
   - Used proper ID validation in all selection logic

2. **Improved Selection Logic**:
   - Replaced Set-based selection with a simpler array-based approach with proper validation
   - Added null/undefined checks throughout the code

3. **Fixed React Key Warnings**:
   - Added unique keys with proper fallbacks: `location-${location.id || index}`
   - Added validation to prevent duplicate keys

4. **Improved Data Persistence**:
   - Added filtering to ensure only valid location IDs are stored

### LocationBlock.tsx

1. **Fixed Data Validation**:

2. **Fixed Empty State Handling**:
   - Improved empty state message to be more descriptive

3. **Fixed Key Generation**:
   - Used consistent key generation with index fallbacks: `grid-loc-${location.id || index}`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add a new Location block
- [ ] Set title and description
- [ ] Select specific locations (not all)
- [ ] Save and verify the preview shows only the selected locations
- [ ] Refresh the page and verify the selections persist
- [ ] Edit the block and toggle locations on/off
- [ ] Switch between list and grid layouts
- [ ] Toggle "Mostrar mapa" option
- [ ] Check console for any React key warnings

## Additional Notes

- The fix handles cases where location IDs might be undefined, which was causing the duplicate key errors
- All data is properly validated before use to prevent undefined values from causing issues
- The console logs have been kept for debugging but can be removed in production
