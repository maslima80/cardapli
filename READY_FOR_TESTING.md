## 🔧 If You Find Issues

### Issue: Zoom still happens on input focus

**Check:**
1. Is viewport meta tag correct in `index.html`?
2. Are inputs using 16px font size on mobile?
3. Is `ios.css` being imported?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Issue: Keyboard covers save button

**Check:**
1. Is viewport listener mounted in `App.tsx`?
2. Are you testing on real device (not simulator)?
3. Is `--keyboard-offset` CSS variable being set?

**Debug:**
```js
// In browser console
getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--keyboard-offset')
// Should show keyboard height when keyboard is open
```

### Issue: Bottom nav floating

**Check:**
1. Does bottom nav have `bottom-nav` class?
2. Is `ios.css` imported before other styles?

**Fix:**
See `src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx` for reference.
