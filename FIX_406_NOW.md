# üî• FIX 406 ERROR - RUN THIS NOW

## The Problem
```
GET .../profiles?select=slug&id=eq.... 406 (Not Acceptable)
```

This happens because **multiple RLS policies on the profiles table are conflicting**.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration
1. Open **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Open file: `NUCLEAR_FIX_RUN_NOW.sql`
3. Copy ALL contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **RUN**

**What it does:**
- Drops ALL existing RLS policies on profiles
- Creates 4 new, clean policies (no conflicts)
- Allows everyone to SELECT profiles (needed for public routing)
- Protects UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE (only own profile)

### Step 2: Code Already Fixed ‚úÖ
The code now uses the RPC function `get_user_profile_data` for verification, which bypasses RLS completely.

## üß™ Test After Running SQL

1. **Refresh your browser** (clear cache if needed)
2. **Create a new test user** or use existing
3. **Try to save a slug**
4. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   [OnboardingWelcome] Update result: {error: null}
   [OnboardingWelcome] Verification fetch: {profileData: [{slug: 'yourslug', ...}], error: null}
   [OnboardingWelcome] Calling onComplete with slug: yourslug
   ```

**NO 406 ERROR!**

## üîç Why This Works

The 406 error happens when PostgREST (Supabase's REST API) can't decide which RLS policy to use because multiple policies have different conditions.

**Before:** Multiple SELECT policies with different `USING` clauses
```sql
POLICY "Users can view their own profile" USING (auth.uid() = id)
POLICY "Anyone can check if slug exists" USING (true)
```
‚ò†Ô∏è **CONFLICT!** PostgREST doesn't know which to use ‚Üí 406 error

**After:** ONE SELECT policy
```sql
POLICY "profiles_select_all" USING (true)
```
‚úÖ **NO CONFLICT!** Clear, simple, works.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Is This Safe?

**YES!** Here's why:
- ‚úÖ Public catalogs NEED to read profiles by slug (for `/u/:slug` routing)
- ‚úÖ UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE are still protected (only own profile)
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data should be filtered at application level anyway
- ‚úÖ This is how most public profile systems work (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working

1. **Check if migration ran:**
   ```sql
   SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
   ```
   Should see exactly 4 policies:
   - `profiles_select_all` (SELECT)
   - `profiles_update_own` (UPDATE)
   - `profiles_insert_own` (INSERT)
   - `profiles_delete_own` (DELETE)

2. **Clear browser cache** and refresh

3. **Check console** for the exact error message

## ‚úÖ Success = No More 406 Errors!
