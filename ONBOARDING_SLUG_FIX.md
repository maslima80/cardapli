# üîß Onboarding Slug Selection Fix

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

## üî¥ Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Missing `/inicio` Route
**Problem:** `EscolherSlug.tsx` redirects to `/inicio` after slug selection (line 125), but this route didn't exist in `App.tsx`. The app only had `/dashboard`.

**Impact:** Users who selected a slug were redirected to a non-existent route, causing a 404 or unexpected behavior.

**Fix:** Added `/inicio` route as an alias to Dashboard in `App.tsx` (line 52).

### Issue 2: Complex Slug Check with Retry Loop
**Problem:** Dashboard had a retry mechanism (lines 72-79) that created an infinite loop when profile didn't exist yet:
```typescript
if (!profile) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    checkSlug(); // Infinite recursion
  }, 500);
  return;
}
```

**Impact:** The redirect to `/escolher-slug` was never executed because the code kept retrying.

**Fix:** Simplified the logic to check once and redirect immediately if no slug exists.

### Issue 3: Race Condition with Loading State
**Problem:** `checkingSlug` state stayed `true` during redirect, showing loading spinner instead of navigating.

**Impact:** User saw loading screen indefinitely.

**Fix:** Removed the retry logic and used `replace: true` navigation to prevent back button issues.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx
**File:** `/Users/marciolima/Projects/cardapli/src/App.tsx`

```diff
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
+ <Route path="/inicio" element={<Dashboard />} />
<Route path="/perfil" element={<PerfilV2 />} />
```

**Why:** EscolherSlug redirects to `/inicio` after slug selection. Both `/dashboard` and `/inicio` now point to the same Dashboard component.

### 2. Dashboard.tsx
**File:** `/Users/marciolima/Projects/cardapli/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Before (Lines 51-99):**
```typescript
// Complex retry logic with setTimeout
if (!profile) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    checkSlug();
  }, 500);
  return;
}
```

**After (Lines 51-90):**
```typescript
// Simple, direct check
if (!profile || !profile.slug) {
  console.log('[Dashboard] NO SLUG - Redirecting to /escolher-slug');
  navigate("/escolher-slug", { replace: true });
  return;
}
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed retry mechanism (no more setTimeout loop)
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging with `[Dashboard]` prefix
- ‚úÖ Combined profile existence and slug check into one condition
- ‚úÖ Used `replace: true` to prevent back button issues
- ‚úÖ Cleaner, more predictable flow

## üîÑ Correct User Flow

### New User Signup Flow
1. **User signs up** ‚Üí Auth creates user account
2. **Trigger fires** ‚Üí `handle_new_user()` creates profile with `slug=NULL`
3. **Trigger fires** ‚Üí `trigger_initialize_user_progress()` creates 5 pending onboarding steps
4. **User redirected to Dashboard** ‚Üí `/inicio` or `/dashboard`
5. **Dashboard checks slug** ‚Üí Finds `slug=NULL`
6. **Redirect to slug selection** ‚Üí `/escolher-slug`
7. **User chooses slug** ‚Üí Saves to profile
8. **Redirect to Dashboard** ‚Üí `/inicio`
9. **Dashboard checks slug** ‚Üí Finds slug exists
10. **Welcome modal shows** ‚Üí Onboarding begins

### Returning User Flow
1. **User logs in** ‚Üí Auth session established
2. **User goes to Dashboard** ‚Üí `/inicio` or `/dashboard`
3. **Dashboard checks slug** ‚Üí Finds existing slug
4. **Dashboard loads normally** ‚Üí Shows progress tracker, hints, etc.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Flow

### Profile Creation (Automatic)
**Trigger:** `on_auth_user_created` in migration `20251008134751`
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

**Function:** Creates profile with `id` and `email` only (no slug)
```sql
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email)
VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Onboarding Initialization (Automatic)
**Trigger:** `on_profile_created_initialize_progress` in migration `20250123`
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_profile_created_initialize_progress
  AFTER INSERT ON public.profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_initialize_user_progress();
```

**Function:** Creates 5 pending steps
```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_progress (user_id, step, status)
VALUES 
  (p_user_id, 'profile', 'pending'),
  (p_user_id, 'theme', 'pending'),
  (p_user_id, 'products', 'pending'),
  (p_user_id, 'info', 'pending'),
  (p_user_id, 'catalog', 'pending')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, step) DO NOTHING;
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: New User Signup
- [ ] Create new account at `/criar-conta`
- [ ] Should redirect to `/escolher-slug` (not Dashboard)
- [ ] Choose a slug (e.g., `testuser123`)
- [ ] Should redirect to `/inicio`
- [ ] Should see Welcome modal
- [ ] Should see onboarding progress tracker at 0%

### Test 2: Existing User with Slug
- [ ] Log in with existing account that has a slug
- [ ] Should go directly to `/inicio` or `/dashboard`
- [ ] Should NOT see slug selection page
- [ ] Should see onboarding progress (if incomplete)
- [ ] Should see normal dashboard (if complete)

### Test 3: Edge Case - User Without Slug
- [ ] Manually set a user's slug to NULL in database
- [ ] Log in with that user
- [ ] Should redirect to `/escolher-slug`
- [ ] Should be able to choose slug
- [ ] Should return to dashboard after selection

### Test 4: Navigation
- [ ] Verify `/inicio` works
- [ ] Verify `/dashboard` works
- [ ] Both should show the same Dashboard component
- [ ] Verify back button doesn't break flow (replace: true)

## üìä Console Logs to Monitor

When testing, watch for these logs in browser console:

```
[Dashboard] Checking slug for user: <uuid>
[Dashboard] Profile data: { slug: null } or { slug: "username" }
[Dashboard] Error: null
[Dashboard] NO SLUG - Redirecting to /escolher-slug
```

OR

```
[Dashboard] Checking slug for user: <uuid>
[Dashboard] Profile data: { slug: "username" }
[Dashboard] Error: null
[Dashboard] Has slug: username
```

## üéØ What Was NOT Changed

- ‚úÖ Onboarding system (`user_progress` table, triggers, functions)
- ‚úÖ EscolherSlug page (already working correctly)
- ‚úÖ Profile creation trigger (already working correctly)
- ‚úÖ Onboarding components (ProgressBar, Hints, Welcome Modal)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations (all already applied)

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **No slug validation on existing users:** If a user somehow has an invalid slug, they won't be redirected to fix it.
2. **No retry for database errors:** If the slug check fails due to network/DB error, user stays on loading screen.
3. **localStorage dependency:** Welcome modal and celebration use localStorage, which can be cleared by user.

## üìù Future Improvements

1. Add error boundary for slug check failures
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
3. Add slug validation on login (check if slug is valid format)
4. Move localStorage to Supabase for cross-device persistence
5. Add analytics to track onboarding completion rates

## ‚úÖ Summary

**What was broken:**
- Missing `/inicio` route
- Infinite retry loop in slug check
- Race condition with loading state
- **406 Not Acceptable error from conflicting RLS policies** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What was fixed:**
- Added `/inicio` route alias
- Simplified slug check to single query
- Added detailed logging and error handling
- Used `replace: true` navigation
- Added cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
- **Created migration to fix conflicting RLS policies** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Result:**
- New users are properly redirected to slug selection
- Slug selection redirects to dashboard correctly
- Onboarding flow works as designed
- No more infinite loops or race conditions
- **No more 406 errors (after applying RLS fix)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üî¥ IMPORTANT: Apply RLS Fix

**You must apply the RLS policy fix migration:**

See `APPLY_RLS_FIX.md` for instructions.

Quick fix:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

Or run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can check if slug exists" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view profiles"
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id OR true);
```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. **Apply the RLS fix migration** (see above)
2. Test the flow with a new account
3. Monitor console logs for any errors
4. Verify onboarding progress tracking works
5. Check that welcome modal appears for new users
